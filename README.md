## Overview
### Description
A chess tracker app that allows a user to look into their chess statistics over time compared to their friends' and other users. 

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Games/Utility
- **Mobile:** Convenience. It is a companion of sorts to a chess mobile app. It may be easier to access your statistics through an app rather than a website. 
- **Story:** Allows users to track their chess statistics and compare it to their friends'
- **Market:** Chess players who want to look at specific statistics and those who want to compare with friends. 
- **Habit:** Most users will use the app every day or at least once a week to track their progress. 
- **Scope:** This app could start off as a simple statistics app that looks at your past ratings compared to your friends. Perhpas, in the future, it could also include a forum of sorts where you can discuss chess with others.
